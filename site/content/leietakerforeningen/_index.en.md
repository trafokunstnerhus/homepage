      The artists in TRAFO kunstnerhus are organized in their own tenants'
      association. The association represents the artists' interests in the
      house as a workplace and serves as the artists' contact organization with
      the Municipality of Oslo and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural
      Heritage. The association is active in the development of the house and is
      a driving force for more studios to be built and used, and for the use of
      the building to match its practical possibilities. At the same time, the
      activity in the house is stimulated through professional and social
      contact. The association's board is elected at the annual meeting in May.
