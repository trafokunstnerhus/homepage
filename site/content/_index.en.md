    TRAFO kunstnerhus is Oslo's largest artist studio complex and a workplace
    for {{< antallKunstnere >}} artists living in Oslo

    The house represents all visual techniques including textile, glass and ceramic techniques. The building currently contains 34 studios, but more are under development. The building has a total area of 6514 square meters. TRAFO artist house is owned and operated by the City of Oslo's Department of Culture, as part of the studio policy adopted by the City Council. The studio policy aims to ensure that Oslo municipality offers suitable workspaces to professional artists living in Oslo. Vacant studios can be applied for by active artists and are allocated according to recommendation from the allocation committee. Announcement of vacant studios and allocation procedure can be found at [the Department of Culture, cultural properties and studios](https://oslo.kommune.no/natur-kultur-og-fritid/lokaler-til-lan-og-leie).


    The studio is awarded from the application. Applicants must document their professional level and high activity in their application, and have a residence address in Oslo. Artists who are awarded a studio receive a 5-year lease contract. It can be applied for a renewal of the contract up to 20 years. If the artistic activity in the rented premises ceases, Kulturetaten can terminate the lease contract before the assigned period has expired.

    TRAFO is an artist house. All visual artists and craftsmen who work
    professionally with art are included in the term artist. Studios can be
    artists in all types of techniques. Each artist is allocated their own
    studio and use it themselves.


    12 studios with direct access from the ground floor are particularly suitable for larger 3-dimensional works and monumental art. Work can be done both indoors and outdoors, and all transportation is easily accessible. The location's work opportunities with such close proximity to the center of Oslo are unique.


    Before the 1970s, it was common for textile artists to work at home. The establishment of a shared workshop with equipment for dyeing yarn, finishing textiles and offering short-term rentals was therefore an important service for artists when TRAFO started in 1975. In the early 1990s, the need was not the same and the joint workshop ceased to exist. Today, there is a shared color studio on the second floor for artists working with this technique.


    A joint workshop for ceramic techniques on the first floor was inaugurated in 2016.
