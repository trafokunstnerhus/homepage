      The substation building has its own history. The building is Oslo's oldest
      transformer station and is also one of the oldest in the country. It is a
      building work in the neoclassical industrial style from 1915, designed by
      architect Thorvald Astrup for Akers Electricity Works. Trafos's property,
      on the edge of Lake Øya, facing the fjord and the city, was at the time
      chosen as the first alternative location when the castle in Oslo was to be
      built.

      The Tøyen transformer station is listed on the Byantikvarens Gule list as worthy of preservation. The building is unique industrial architecture, and the facades facing the road are protected.

    text: In the 1970s, a new transformer station was built next to the old one on
      Tøyen, and gradually the old one was evacuated. In its place, there was a
      hollow shell, dilapidated and marked by hard use.

    text: The Young Artists Society, UKS, was established at the beginning of the
      1970s to create its own studio committee to meet the increasingly strong
      demand for new studios for artists in Oslo. The committee, led by Kari
      Rolfsen, made a significant effort to get the municipality to take
      responsibility for helping to alleviate the studio shortage for artists in
      Oslo. It had experience with many places in Oslo, including the old
      transformer station on Tøyen. Through negotiations with the Oslo
      municipality, it became clear that the municipality, which owned the
      former Oslo Lighting Works, could make the building available to the
      artists against the condition that they themselves would cover all
      renovation and interior work, with a rental exemption for the investment.
      This was advantageous for the artists. The building had a basement and a
      relatively inexpensive interior, well suited for studios and individual
      efforts.

  - heading: Established
    text: The City Council in Oslo decided in the fall of 1972 to establish TRAFO
      Tøyen cultural house as studios for visual artists and spaces for the Oslo
      Theater Center. The official opening of what was then called Tøyen
      cultural house, TRAFO, took place on September 2, 1975. From the start,
      there were 10 sculpture studios, 6 painting studios, and a common workshop
      for 4 textile artists. For sculptors, where an increase in commissions in
      the 70s and 80s made monumental studios in demand, 12 of the studios with
      individual access from the hillside were a good opportunity to work both
      indoors and outdoors. This also facilitated easier transport of heavier
      materials.

    text: Oslo kommune fikk leie tidligere Tøyen trafostasjon gratis av Oslo
      lysverker i 1972. Den gang var Oslo lysverker 100 % eid av Oslo kommune.
      Lysverket ble privatisert på slutten av 80-tallet. Oslo kommune ble da
      hovedaksjonær i Oslo Energi. Ved denne politiske handling “glemte”
      politikerne å videreføre kunstnernes avtale med Oslo kommune. Oslo Energi
      ble sent på 90-tallet solgt videre til Hafslund, fortsatt med Oslo kommune
      som største aksjonær.

    text: Oslo municipality rented the former Tøyen transformer station for free
      from Oslo Lighting Works in 1972. At that time, Oslo Lighting Works was
      100% owned by Oslo municipality. The lighting company was privatized in
      the late 1980s. Oslo municipality then became the main shareholder in Oslo
      Energy. Through this political action, the politicians "forgot" to
      continue the artists' agreement with Oslo municipality. Oslo Energy was
      sold in the 1990s to Hafslund, still with Oslo municipality as the largest
      shareholder.
